# Rewarded Ad

> **Warning**
> <br/>For a single instance of BidonRewardedAd, Load() and Show() can only be called once. Create a new instance for every new rewarded ad opportunity.

## Load Rewarded Ad

To load rewarded ad, first create a `BidonRewardedAd` instance. Specify placement (only if needed), otherwise placement = "default" will be used.

```c#
var bidonRewarded = new BidonRewardedAd("PLACEMENT_NAME");
```

Subscribe to desired events for receiving callbacks during ad object lifecycle.

```c#
bidonRewarded.OnAdLoaded += (sender, args) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"Ecpm: {args.Ad?.Ecpm}");
};
```
